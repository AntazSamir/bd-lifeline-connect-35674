This project appears to be a Blood Donation Platform (likely named "BD Lifeline Connect"), designed to connect blood donors with patients in need. It leverages Supabase for the backend (database & authentication) and a modern React stack for the frontend.

Core Purpose
The application serves as a bridge between blood donors and recipients, allowing users to:

Request Blood: Post urgent needs for blood donations.
Find Donors: Search for available donors based on blood group and location.
Manage Profiles: Maintain donor status and personal information.
Key Features & Workflow
1. User Access & Authentication
Sign Up / Sign In: Users can create accounts (/sign-up) and log in (/sign-in).
Email Verification: Includes an email confirmation flow (/confirm-email) to verify users.
Profile Completion: After signing up, users are guided to complete their profile (/complete-profile), likely to collect essential details like blood group and location.
2. Blood Requests
View Requests (/request-blood): A public feed where users can see current blood needs.
Create Request (/create-request): Authenticated users can post new blood requests, specifying details like:
Blood Group
Location / Hospital
Urgency (Immediate, Urgent, Flexible)
Contact Information
3. Donor Network
Find Donors (/find-donors): A search interface to locate donors. It likely allows filtering by blood group and location to find matches quickly.
Donor Status: Users can probably toggle their availability to donate in their profile.
4. User Dashboard
Profile Management (/profile or /dashboard): A central hub for users to:
View and edit their personal info.
Manage their own blood requests.
Update their donation history or availability.
Technical Architecture
Frontend: Built with React, Vite, and TypeScript.
Styling: Uses Tailwind CSS and shadcn-ui for a modern, responsive design.
Backend (Supabase):
Database: Stores blood_requests, donors, and user_profiles.
Auth: Handles user registration and session management.
Security: Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only edit their own data while keeping requests and donor lists publicly viewable.
How It Should Work (User Flow)
Visitor: Lands on the home page (/), can browse "Find Donors" or "Blood Requests" immediately.
Registration: To post a request or become a donor, the visitor signs up.
Onboarding: The user completes their profile, adding their blood group and location.
Action:
Need Blood? The user creates a request. It appears on the public feed.
Want to Donate? The user sets themselves as "Available" and appears in donor searches.
Connection: Interested donors contact the requester via the provided phone number.
